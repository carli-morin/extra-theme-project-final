        <p> A Fool's Guide to Fenway Park is a graphic book that any Boston Red Sox fan can use to reference throughout their experience at Fenway Park. My inspiration throughout A Fool’s Guide to Fenway Park was to show the culture of being a Red Sox fan and giving the fans a different experience from any of the typical guidebooks. My job as a security guard for the Boston Red Sox was a true inspiration for this book because I love the atmosphere of every game and how excited Boston fans are to be at Fenway Park. The culture of Red Sox nation is different than anything I have ever experience because the Major League Baseball teams play the most games in any major league sport with 162 games a year and a possibility of playoffs. The MLB teams are almost playing a game for half of every single year and somehow there is always a big crowd at Fenway Park. Fenway Park is the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball and it hold truly meaningful history to any Red Sox fan. The ballpark always needs repairs due to it’s age but, it holds a different value to everyone when they have grown up in Boston. The traditions and history is the main thing I wanted to highlight throughout the book but, I wanted to give a different perspective on it.

    <p> The idea of A Fool’s Guide to Fenway Park was to provide all Red Sox fans with an aesthetically pleasing book that would highlight information not every fan is aware of. I found providing only information would make the book seem uninteresting. I wanted to make a guidebook that would provide a lively experience for the viewer. The book is more marketed towards the fans who are trying to save money on their trip to Fenway Park because each page is filled with cost efficient ways to have fun. Also, the aspect of chaos became an important element to my book because anytime you walk through Fenway Park during a game it is completely disordered. The chaotic atmosphere is something every fan experiences and it somehow adds to the fun of the whole experience. A Fool’s Guide to Fenway Park is for Red Sox fans to use at their own leisure by providing them with more information and keeping the delightful experience of Fenway Park at the tip of their fingertips.
